My name is Robert Nowotniak, and I’m a computer scientist with 15+ years of experience, based in Poland.\
In 2015, I received a PhD degree in CS from [Lodz University of Technology](https://www.p.lodz.pl/en) for my contributions to quantum-inspired genetic and evolutionary algorithms, their theoretical analysis and introduction of novel higher-order quantum-inspired algorithms.
