## I'm using GitHub under protest
My projects are currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; **GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software**
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop FOSS projects.

Please read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

**Any use of my projects' code by COPILOT AI, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of my projects
code in COPILOT.**
