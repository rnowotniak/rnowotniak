My name is Robert Nowotniak, and Iâ€™m a computer scientist with more than 15 years of experience, based in Poland.\
In 2015, I received a PhD degree from [Lodz University of Technology](https://www.p.lodz.pl/en) for my contributions to quantum-inspired genetic and evolutionary algorithms, their theoretical analysis and introduction of novel higher-order quantum-inspired algorithms.
